Project Overview
The Cypress system is a web application that allows its Toronto users to report and track problems they notice on city streets. The Cypress system allows its citizens to pinpoint the location of the problem on a user-friendly map with arbitrary accuracy, accurately specify the type of problem, and report it to the City of Toronto with all necessary details. Also, citizens can consult the map to learn about the problems in a given area without false/duplicate reports and more.
